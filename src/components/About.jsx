      <p className="mb-4">Ressurreccion — the Spanish word for resurrection — is the revival of streetwear through a refined lens. Our philosophy blends the energy of the city with the quiet confidence of minimal design.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">We design elevated essentials with sharp tailoring, premium fabrics, and architectural silhouettes. Each piece is built to move through the city — day to night, concrete to spotlight — with understated luxury.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Our mission is simple: elevate streetwear without losing its soul. This is street elegance reborn.</p>
